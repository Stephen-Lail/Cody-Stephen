In this repositor you can find the code we used for the circuit, how to put a circuit together, and the diagram for our circuit.

Instructions for building circuit

1. Using the description above, the photo, and https://docs.particle.io/getting-started/hardware-tutorials/hardware-examples/#blink-an-external-led, build the external LED circuit.
2. Draw a circuit diagram corresponding to your circuit using circuit-diagram.org. To complete this exercise, you will have to look up examples of "led circuit diagrams" online. You will have to show the following for full credit:
    The Argon's GPIO pin and ground pin (the Boron serves as our power supply, but swap out the power supply/battery symbol that shows up in most LED circuit diagram examples for a rectangle representing the Argon and its many pins. Refer to the Argon pinout (on Particle docs or last week's lab notes) for more detail.
    The LED's cathode and anode
    Both sides of the resistor
3. Before plugging in the USB cable, confirm with Bresnahan that your circuit looks correct.
4. Blink the LED using our old Blink_LED project but changing from the pin that we used in that script (to blink the onboard LED) to the pin corresponding to the GPIO pin you chose for this circuit. Make sure you change all references to the pin in the script.
